/*
 * Collections is C#'s way of defining lists and dictionaries / Queue's and Stack's.
 * This would be useful for algorithm and data structure implementation.
 * Why use a sorted list(allows you to access items by key) when you already have a hashtable.
 * something to do with performance but will investigate this further.
 * Add objects of any kind to an ArrayList collection.
 * Retrieving items from a collection must be done explicitly. 
 * Its best to use a foreach loop to iterate over the collection.

/*
 * Collections is C#'s way of defining lists and dictionaries / Queue's and Stack's.
 * This would be useful for algorithm and data structure implementation.
 * Why use a sorted list(allows you to access items by key) when you already have a hashtable.
 * something to do with performance but will investigate this further.
 * Add objects of any kind to an ArrayList collection.
 * Retrieving items from a collection must be done explicitly. 
 * Its best to use a foreach loop to iterate over the collection.
 * Study the lambda method, seems important and present all over olo repositories
 * Keeping the IComparer class in mind is important when trying to sort over arraylists
 * of user defined datatypes such as classes. In this case we could examine the student class,
 * Considering two students and sorting them on the basis of their age.

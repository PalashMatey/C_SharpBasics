/*The difference between inheritance and adding an object to another class is that in inheritance, you can assume the 
properties of the base class. It would not get added to your class or associated with it, just will make writing of the 
code simpler as you will not have to add repeat properties to the class.
Abstract classes are useful when you do not have to every use the base class. You just want to use the properties, and methods.
Defining a method as virtual in the abstract class(base class) means that it can be overridden in the subclass. 
This means that the subclasses can either accept the inherited implementation or accept the implementation that is inherited.
If a method is declared as abstract in an abstract class it must be implemented in the subclass, else it would throw a compiler error.
Abstract method is not permitted to have any implementation, read earlier statement.

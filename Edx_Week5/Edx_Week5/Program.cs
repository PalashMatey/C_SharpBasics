//use of partial classes to split the class over various source files which can all be combined during compile.
//constructors have the same name as the class but they also have parameters which are used to initialize variables.
//constructors can be used to directly initialize the variables at the time of object creation.
//regardless of the instances of a class, there is always only one static member. Typically you do not need to instantiate a class in order to use a static member.
//Anonymous classes, way of encapsulating read only properties into a single object without the need to explicitly define a type first.
//However you cannot define methods for anonymous classes
